I can see all the view by the sea
Citizen&#39;s smiles look carfree
Good night, the brillliant heartland
Break up the skyscraper with a bang

Tsunami of information
Superficial communication
Public transportation working on
Comprehensive automation
Now, conquer the monstrosity
The corruption made by humanity
The start when presidency ends

No father, no Jesus, no chaos
Miracle is dead
Miracle is dead!
The scheme makes them stay unread

Look at a test-tube baby
I was born of it. Woe is me!
No one sleeps with honey
The supreme shape of love, isn&#39;t it?

Tsunami of information
Superficial communication
Public transportation working on
Comprehensive automation
Now, conquer the monstrosity
The corruption made by humanity
The start when the presidency ends

No father, no Jesus, no chaos
Miracle is dead
Miracle is dead!
The scheme makes them stay unread
As our predecessors said
Miracle is dead
It&#39;s a miniature garden
We all live in

No father, no Jesus, no chaos
Miracle is dead
Miracle is dead!
The scheme makes them stay unread

No father, no Jesus, no chaos
Miracle is dead
Miracle is dead!
The scheme makes them stay unread
As our predecessors said
Miracle is dead
It&#39;s a miniature garden
We all live in

Tsunami of information
Superficial communication
Public transformation working on
(It&#39;s a miniature garden)
Comprehensive automation
Now conquer the monstrosity
(We all live in)
The corruption made by humanity
(Beat the queen)
The start where presidency ends
(Beat the queen of false heaven)
&lt;/div&gt;
